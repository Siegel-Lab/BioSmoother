# smoother todo (ranked)

- anotation coord system should allow all annotations to be picked
    - if an annotation that is not filterable is picked and 'multiple annos in bin' is set to 'combine', an error should be thrown.
- move all the tooltips and button names into config files.
    - use these files for the interface AND the set/get commands.
- upload session button
- remove default.json from smoother_hg
- store in index what filters are active / inactive (data is now stored)
  - enable/disable appropriate filters (on a per dataset bases & disable button if no dataset contains the filter)
  - filters can be activated on a per replicate basis -> rather store proper default values for each deactivated filter
  - if no replicate contains a certain filter, disable the button

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
