# smoother todo (ranked)

- v4c viewpoint not updating for chr7_core
- be able to import files with counts instead of raw reads
- importing tracks 
- max number of characters for axis labels -> properly (only on axis lables not in hover)

- remove default.json from smoother_hg
- sort session .json into static values & parameters
    -  exclude static values form undo & redo

# presentation

- published data, that's not tryps (cancer, human)
    - hi-c & radicl-seq
- structure also for other purposes
    - in databases (plain computer science)
    - for a chip seq viewer?
    - other live sciences?
    - e.g. google maps / other heatmaps
- one main figure about the algorithmmics
- why is this needed (as a figure)
    - advantages of the tool
