- generating index without multimapping and categories creates wired result...
- if no read is loaded there is only a very crypic error once you try to look at the index
    - this can happen if for example the contig names do not match...
- no annotation filter is displaying empty bins only
- opening view->color tab causes rerender
- sortable multi choice: column labels and checkboxes not aligned
- sort session .json into static values & parameters
    -  exclude static values form undo & redo
- application mode with browsers (i.e. chrome fallback firefox) - integrate from desktop versions
- svg output
    - works in principle
    - missing:
        - axis lables & ticks
        - overlays (e.g. contig border)
- virtual 4C functionality
- extra plots could be auto hidden while empty -> anno cov ddd slice_rankings
    - also column sum & row sum coverage does not need to exist if zero

# verification

- check if lines coincide with rRNA / ncRNA / snoRNA / tRNA

# presentation

- published data, that's not tryps (cancer, human)
    - hi-c & radicl-seq
- structure also for other purposes
    - in databases (plain computer science)
    - for a chip seq viewer @todo?
    - other live sciences?
    - e.g. google maps / other heatmaps
- one main figure about the algorithmmics
- why is this needed (as a figure)
    - advantages of the tool
