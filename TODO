# smoother todo (ranked)

- normalization of tracks needs rework:
    - tracks should have a group a and group b
    - display on column or row or both should be a dropdown button
    - the merge datasets and datapools by option should be available, so that one track can be normalized by another
- remove default.json from smoother_hg
- multichoice menus are not very responsive (i.e. they should interrupt rendering)

--- cutoff ---

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
