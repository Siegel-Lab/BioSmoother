# smoother todo (ranked)

- annotation filter dimensions do not make sense right now
  - should rather have one dimension per filterable annotation
  - more flexibility
- remove default.json from smoother_hg

- store in index what filters are active / inactive (data is now stored)
  - enable/disable appropriate filters
  - filters can be activated on a per replicate basis -> rather store proper default values for each deactivated filter
  - if no replicate contains a certain filter, disable the button

--- cutoff ---

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
