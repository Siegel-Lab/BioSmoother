- binominal test is fucked up for sure -> should reach zero deviance in experiment
- annotation filter dimensions do not make sense right now
  - should rather have one dimension per filterable annotation
  - more flexibility
- remove default.json from smoother_hg


--- cutoff ---

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
