# smoother todo (ranked)

- secondary data panel: lines should always to down to zero
- bin test on rows is messed up

- binominal test is fucked up for sure -> should reach zero deviance in experiment
- annotation filter dimensions do not make sense right now
  - should rather have one dimension per filterable annotation
  - more flexibility
- remove default.json from smoother_hg

- changing some parameters should trigger other parameters to change:
    - changing to subtraction should adjust color scale to [-1,1] and scaling of values to absolute max
    - going to binom test should set comparison to min is comp was set to sum
    - also there should be a system to change the parameters back...

--- cutoff ---

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
