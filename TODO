# smoother todo (ranked)

- V4C:
    - x-axis indicator not updating
    - x-axis track giving different results that y-axis (x-axis seems wired...)
- coordinate picker is messed up for anno coords and in general as well?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
- annotation panel not visible if contigs not shown and only v4c active 
- change visibility on contigs: click hits wrong cell
- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- remove default.json from smoother_hg
