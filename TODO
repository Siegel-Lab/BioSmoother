# smoother todo (ranked)

- V4C:
    - x-axis indicator not updating
    - x-axis track giving different results that y-axis (x-axis seems wired...)
- coordinate picker is messed up for anno coords and in general as well?
- binominal test is fucked up for sure -> should reach zero deviance in experiment
- annotation filter dimensions do not make sense right now
  - should rather have one dimension per filterable annotation
  - more flexibility
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
- ploidy & contig lables does not work together (extremely short labels)
- dots in contig names do not work with search
- annotation panel not visible if contigs not shown and only v4c active 
- ploidy correction: add more options
- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- remove default.json from smoother_hg
