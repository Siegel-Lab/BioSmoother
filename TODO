# smoother todo (ranked)

- better categories
    - implement better layout
- sortable multi choice: column labels and checkboxes not aligned
- extra plots could be auto hidden while empty -> anno cov ddd slice_rankings
    - also column sum & row sum coverage does not need to exist if zero
- application mode with browsers (i.e. chrome fallback firefox) - integrate from desktop versions
- svg output
- AutocompleteInput for filepath
    - when calling give folder where indices are located
    - restrict for public hosting

# verification

- check if lines coincide with rRNA / ncRNA / snoRNA / tRNA

# presentation

- published data, that's not tryps (cancer, human)
    - hi-c & radicl-seq
- structure also for other purposes
    - in databases (plain computer science)
    - for a chip seq viewer @todo?
    - other live sciences?
    - e.g. google maps / other heatmaps
- one main figure about the algorithmmics
- why is this needed (as a figure)
    - advantages of the tool
