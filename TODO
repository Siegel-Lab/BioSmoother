# smoother todo (ranked)

- opening a read only index causes segmentation faults
- in export there is a bug -> see exporting annotations & chip-seq data
- in export put top bar with coordinates
- log rendering is messed up!
- remove default.json from smoother_hg
- binom. test norm: what is going wrong?
- store in index what filters are active / inactive (data is now stored)
  - enable/disable appropriate filters (on a per dataset bases & disable button if no dataset contains the filter)
  - filters can be activated on a per replicate basis -> rather store proper default values for each deactivated filter
  - if no replicate contains a certain filter, disable the button

--- cutoff ---

- how about a RPKB (reads per kilobase) normalization?
- export: font size, stroke widths, whitespace distances should all go in config
    - some should effect viewer as well
