# smoother todo

- grid seq norm progress print
- AutocompleteInput for filepath
    - when calling give folder where indices are located
    - restrict for public hosting
- application mode with browsers (i.e. chrome fallback firefox) - integrate from desktop versions
- presetting load and save -> status print
- coverage hover
- categorical axis for labels chromosome & number

# verification

- does radicl sec do normalization for rna?
- uneven distribution between contigs in grid seq normalization
- mapping quality and uneven alignments
- check if lines coincide with rRNA / ncRNA / snoRNA / tRNA



# presentation

- published data, that's not tryps (cancer, human)
    - hi-c & radicl-seq
- structure also for other purposes
    - in databases (plain computer science)
    - for a chip seq viewer
    - other live sciences?
    - e.g. google maps / other heatmaps
- one main figure about the algorithmmics
- why is this needed (as a figure)
    - advantages of the tool
