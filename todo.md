PRIORITY: (low to high effort)
- does radicl sec do normalization for rna?
- uneven distribution between contigs in grid seq normalization
- hi-c normalization

LOW - PRIORITY:
- multiple servers in same system
- write down normalizations
- keep reads that map only to one bin
- pick different color palettes
- grid seq norm progress print
- read normalization -> reads per million & count number of reads via query
- quick config buttons
- https://stxxl.org/tags/1.4.1/common_io_counter.html
- remove yellow color in coverage tracks
- separate pickers for showing normalization reads and normalizing by them
- column coordinates -> remove axis coords
- columns/row chromosomes pickers -> wrong way round
    - axis labels are wrong!
- organize code
- put help messages
- give buttons better names
- AutocompleteInput for filepath
    - when calling give folder where indices are located
    - restrict for public hosting
- application mode with browsers (i.e. chrome fallback firefox)
- try webgl
- show color bar according to log coordinate
- close server quicker -> onunload javascript event (maybe fake button that)
