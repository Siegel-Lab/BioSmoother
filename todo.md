PRIORITY: (low to high effort)
- chromosome picker
- helper gets left behind sometimes (zombie process)
- nomalizations via GRID-seq way (bins instead of RNA & theshold settable) and RADICAL-seq way
- EXTRACT function
- filter by annotation
- cancel render

LOW - PRIORITY:
- no squared bins
- general tab should be open by default
- multiple servers in same system
- normalization by row as well as column
- scale by default
- rendering do r/n? en
- row/col norm switched in preprocess.sh? - yes
- save pictures
- pick port dynamically
- samtools i.e. conda environment
- normalization by coverage tracks with one axis empty gives zero everywhere
- normalization: only column or only row
- substract & difference: rename to a-b |a-b|
- everything must be clickable while rendering
- excentuated normalization
- write down normalizations
- keep reads that map only to one bin
- pick different color palettes
- generate index progress print
