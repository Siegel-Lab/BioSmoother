PRIORITY: (low to high effort)
- cancel render
- mapping quality
- build times

MEDIUM:
- EXTRACT function
- filter to show only that overlay annotation x

LOW - PRIORITY:
- multiple servers in same system
- scale by default
- rendering do r/n? en
- row/col norm switched in preprocess.sh? - yes
- save pictures
- pick port dynamically or allow picking port
- samtools i.e. conda environment
- substract & difference: rename to a-b |a-b|
- everything must be clickable while rendering
- excentuated normalization
- write down normalizations
- keep reads that map only to one bin
- pick different color palettes
- grid seq norm progress print
- read normalization -> reads per million & count number of reads via query
- S+ tree
    - align overlay entries to blocks
    - align points to blocks
- by placing overlay at bottom left, memory can be saved...
- quick config buttons
- status to top
