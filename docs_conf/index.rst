Smoother is an interactive analysis and visualization software for nucleic acid interactome data that allows the change of parameters such as normalization, bin size or MAPQ on-the-fly. Smoother can load multiple samples which can be grouped and compared. Smoother also allows filtering by annotations and the display of coverage for additional sequencing data.

Smoother is centered around an index including the genome, annotations, and datasets to be analyzed and visualized. Using this index, Smoother allows changing analysis parameters on-the-fly.
